Project description


- Nowadays is truly important the use of the internet in order to earn more income to any business. However, there still exists local/medium business that do not operate using internet technology. This put them in a big disadvantage compared to other businesses on the same branch.
There are business as Rappi, Uber eats, Cornershop, etc. that solve in a certain way this issue. However, this can help some businesses to grow but not all of them; since these apps operate in a way in which users are targeted with popular businesses first, letting most of the “new” and “unpopular” ones with no benefits. Also, this type of apps work with just one type of business: restaurants.
On the other hand, our plan is to make an online stores hub in which we will be giving local businesses a section on the internet in which they can customize their catalogue: adding/removing items, adding/removing discounts; monitor their sales (sold items, popular sold items, etc.); changing their online store appearance, among other functionalities. And, putting themselves under the radar.
Moreover, we are giving the users the chance of finding stores, of any type, near them. Also, giving them the chance of creating the cart and once the user wants to proceed with the buy, letting the vendor know about this order for he to group all the corresponding products and keep the order ready for the customer arrival. In addition, searching stores by products in storage is something a user can do.

- This project will have the aim of improving the performance of local convenience stores, with the end goal of promoting and aiding local stores entrepreneurs seeking to increase the amount of independent owned business and providing the buyer more options at the moment of deciding where to buy.
